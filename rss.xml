            <title><![CDATA[Maryam]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Maryam</h1><p>My name is Maryam Ali. I am 17. I am Chinese. I am Pakistani. I am American. I am Muslim. I am a Woman. And my voice is being held captive against my will by restraints made of western bigotry. In every direction I turn I find people undermining my power, my voice, my intellect, my humanity, and my integrity. I grew up raised in a strict Islamic household, but I am not oppressed. I am not ISIS. And I should not and will not feel responsible or apologize for the crimes they have committed in the name of my peaceful religion.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/597249b1d0fe25f2d4968c747cd6e8e5b272f41a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Lorax</h1><p>At what moment did you find what you wanted to do with the rest of your life? The moment I knew I wanted to pursue rapping did not come from a music video, nor did it come from the loud pulsating bass or a roaring crowd. It came from my 7th grade social studies class, watching a movie titled “Green”. A movie with no words, it vividly detailed the mass destruction of precious Indonesian rainforest for Palm Oil plantations, and chronicled the rescue and rehabilitation of an Orangutan in which the movie is named after. I loathed and decried the lack of empathy and evil that lied in humans, and it haunted me for a solid 3 years. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a0914c24b9e4997c074625207d225784224eb5fa.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Jake</h1><p>Hi, My name is Jake Montes Adams. Most people understand to some extent that the history of the indigenous peoples of this country is a dark, sad one. But to a lot of people, that history is just history- a chapter in a textbook to be discussed in APUSH classrooms. When people talk about Native Americans, it’s usually in the past tense. In the minds of many we are gone, relegated to the same cultural space as the wild west and gold rushes. Our absence is known as an unfortunate side effect of the creation of a free, democratic nation.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/61ac7675c0f8599a63399eac97cc3d0d186bdfdc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Brendan</h1><p>Hey Youth and Government. I’m Brendan Thompson, a junior from the North Valley YMCA. Y & G has brought so much joy and passion into my life. Sacramento 2015 was probably the best week of my life. Unfortunately that’s not what I’ll be sharing with you today. What I will be sharing are my worst weeks, my lowest points and how I both overcame and learned from them.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/804b27d646b3897d5870955c6bfe1adfd687fd6b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
