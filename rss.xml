            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Payton Reil</h1><p>Growing up I never felt like I had a voice. Since the beginning of second grade throughout most of high school. In delegation meetings I didn't talk and I made three friends my first year in the program. I learned a lot throughout this first year. Everyone has an opinion and we should all be able to express it in whatever way we choose. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8ed2cfecb8f4736c43a130e36948aefec3abf50e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Jorge Santiago</h1><p>​The year was 2012, it was my first year in Y&G, I had just met my forum group, and right away, we were supposed to make a speech to garner votes from our peers in order to gain the program area that we desired. My heart pounded, knees grew weak, and I felt like throwing up. I had never been exposed to people not from the surrounding area of LA where I grew up in. My panic and fear quickly turned to anger and frustration when I overheard a couple NCDM delegates (their jackets/sweaters said that name) talking about giving each other their vote to get their desired program area. It angered me that they would rig the process so as to give themselves the win as if they were entitled to it. This anger and passion sprung out of me like a roaring fire that encompassed my mind like a swamping flood overpowering every other thought process including my fear. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/27ec92f0d4d0c72ed1a38bdd497000c91979dca5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ilana Holzman</h1><p>My names Ilana Holzman and I'm apart of The Conejo Valley delegation.  Being apart of Y and G has helped me learn so much about the government and even more about myself. This amazing program has helped me end my fear of public speaking and has helped me become better at standing up and saying what I belief and not being shot down because they don't belief it's "right thing". It (Y&G) taught me to be able to get up in class and speak. Y and g has taught me that I have an opinion and my opinion matters</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9cd15370c1f14febeb05bc123f17ddea67309951.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Maryam</h1><p>My name is Maryam Ali. I am 17. I am Chinese. I am Pakistani. I am American. I am Muslim. I am a Woman. And my voice is being held captive against my will by restraints made of western bigotry. In every direction I turn I find people undermining my power, my voice, my intellect, my humanity, and my integrity. I grew up raised in a strict Islamic household, but I am not oppressed. I am not ISIS. And I should not and will not feel responsible or apologize for the crimes they have committed in the name of my peaceful religion.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/597249b1d0fe25f2d4968c747cd6e8e5b272f41a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Lorax</h1><p>At what moment did you find what you wanted to do with the rest of your life? The moment I knew I wanted to pursue rapping did not come from a music video, nor did it come from the loud pulsating bass or a roaring crowd. It came from my 7th grade social studies class, watching a movie titled “Green”. A movie with no words, it vividly detailed the mass destruction of precious Indonesian rainforest for Palm Oil plantations, and chronicled the rescue and rehabilitation of an Orangutan in which the movie is named after. I loathed and decried the lack of empathy and evil that lied in humans, and it haunted me for a solid 3 years. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8270a791ebf209f21eeb779ae3597c6ae1a00620.jpg"></article>]]></description>
