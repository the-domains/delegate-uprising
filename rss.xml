            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Jake</h1><p>Hi, My name is Jake Montes Adams. Most people understand to some extent that the history of the indigenous peoples of this country is a dark, sad one. But to a lot of people, that history is just history- a chapter in a textbook to be discussed in APUSH classrooms. When people talk about Native Americans, it’s usually in the past tense. In the minds of many we are gone, relegated to the same cultural space as the wild west and gold rushes. Our absence is known as an unfortunate side effect of the creation of a free, democratic nation.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/497f3e000a7423269f576845be8eb47e9e7586cd.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Brendan</h1><p>Hey Youth and Government. I’m Brendan Thompson, a junior from the North Valley YMCA. Y & G has brought so much joy and passion into my life. Sacramento 2015 was probably the best week of my life. Unfortunately that’s not what I’ll be sharing with you today. What I will be sharing are my worst weeks, my lowest points and how I both overcame and learned from them.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/804b27d646b3897d5870955c6bfe1adfd687fd6b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
