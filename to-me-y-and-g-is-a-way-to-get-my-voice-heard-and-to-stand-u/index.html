<p>To me, Y and G is a way to get my voice heard and to stand up for the people who don't exactly know how to stand up for themselves. I love to help people it gives me a warm feeling on the inside when I know I helped someone out. If I can change the way some people think that's I want in life. I want to start my changing or impacting a persons life even if starts with just one person. Thanks to Y and G I found my platform to express to people on how I feel and how we can change the world. When I was running for chief clerk of the assembly during this 68th MLC, I wasn't sure if I should run. It was my first conference so I felt like I was hanging on a piece of thread but never did I know that the thread was mere passion. I didn't even know I was supposed to say a speech the night of the election. But the moment my voice hit the mic, everything changed. The passion inside of me to help people took over my speech. I was afraid that my voice wasn't heard the way I'd wanted it to. But after I spoke a delegate walked up to me with tears in their eyes and said, " you changed my life." Those 4 words were all I needed to know that I am doing something right. It wasn't ever about the winning it was always about changing someone's life. Thank you Y&G for helping me raise my voice.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">Delegate Uprising</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
