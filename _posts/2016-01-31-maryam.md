# Maryam

My name is Maryam Ali. I am 17\. I am Chinese. I am Pakistani. I am American. I am Muslim. I am a Woman. And my voice is being held captive against my will by restraints made of western bigotry. In every direction I turn I find people undermining my power, my voice, my intellect, my humanity, and my integrity. I grew up raised in a strict Islamic household, but I am not oppressed. I am not ISIS. And I should not and will not feel responsible or apologize for the crimes they have committed in the name of my peaceful religion.

As a woman who chooses to wear the hijab (scarf around my head), I do not feel less of a person for it. I feel empowered. I feel empowered by the fact that no matter where I go, I am a symbol of my beliefs. I feel empowered by the fact that my hijab's purpose is to take away the idea that women exist only for beauty of the eyes and instead should be loved for the beauty of her heart. I feel empowered by the fact that my hijab gives me an opportunity to be respected for my beliefs and my intellect.

However, these feelings of empowerment seem to threaten the world that I live in today. White feminism, anti-islam groups, Trump supporters, and ignorant people think they have the right to tell ME how to feel. They think they have the right to speak for ME and to voice MY opinion. No. MY religion means MY right to speak MY opinions and MY beliefs. No one gets to demonize my faith with ignorance and undermine the beauty of a religion that is practiced by billions around the world . No one gets to tell me I am oppressed. I am not oppressed. I am in power with a voice louder than most because the louder my voice the closer I am to breaking the restraints that are trying so hard to lock me down, and Y&G is my platform to do so. And for that I thank you, Youth & Government for the giving me the opportunity to continue to work my way free from those restraints.
