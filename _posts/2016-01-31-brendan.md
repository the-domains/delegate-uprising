# Brendan

Hey Youth and Government. I'm Brendan Thompson, a junior from the North Valley YMCA. Y & G has brought so much joy and passion into my life. Sacramento 2015 was probably the best week of my life. Unfortunately that's not what I'll be sharing with you today. What I will be sharing are my worst weeks, my lowest points and how I both overcame and learned from them.

Apparently my mom saw it in me from a young age. It wasn't until I was a teenager that it became fully realized to myself. The actual dates and years are a bit jumbled in my head which I guess is a good thing. In the fall of the 8th grade, I wanted to die. More than anything else. It crept up on me pretty quick. All of a sudden I couldn't do homework. And then I couldn't handle school. Or food. Eventually sleep was a luxury that I know longer knew. All I know were dark thoughts and tears. Words didn't come so easily. I'm sparing you the fine details, but all of a sudden I was better. A pill had fixed it all in the matter of a night when it was meant to take weeks. I'll never know why or how it worked so fast. All I can be is grateful.

The story doesn't end there. Nearly six months later I was right back where I started. I had stopped taking my meds. I wanted to die again. This time I ended up in a hospital. It was a terrible and great place. A room full of unstable teens with nothing to do half the time. The average stay was apparently 3 to 5 days. I was there nearly two weeks. I fought, I cried, I made friends, and well I started to get better. A little too much better.

I ended up back in the hospital less than a month later. This time not for depression, but mania. I had gone insane. I won't go into the fine details again, but I had developed insomnia, started talking to myself, and thought I was some sort of god. I thought I could manipulate anyone and understand anything. Turns out I'm bipolar and shouldn't be on antidepressants.

My story may seem a bit sad, but that's not the point. The point is I'm better now. The point is I have a wonderful life now. And if you're going through anything, please know you can get through it too however impossible it may seem. I still take my medication and go to therapy today. Those things don't work for everyone, but I highly recommend you start by seeing a professional. The topic of mental health is very dear to me. Bipolar disorder and depression runs in my family. With my aspirations to be a politician I hope that one day I can make a difference for those who need it and that my condition won't hold me back. If you ever need me I'm just an email or a message away, because when so many suffer with their guards up, I know that a conversation has the potential to save a life.
