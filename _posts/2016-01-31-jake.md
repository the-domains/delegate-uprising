# Jake

Hi, My name is Jake Montes Adams. Most people understand to some extent that the history of the indigenous peoples of this country is a dark, sad one. But to a lot of people, that history is just history- a chapter in a textbook to be discussed in APUSH classrooms. When people talk about Native Americans, it's usually in the past tense. In the minds of many we are gone, relegated to the same cultural space as the wild west and gold rushes. Our absence is known as an unfortunate side effect of the creation of a free, democratic nation.

I understand why this happens, of course. It was engineered this way. Tribes are relegated to small and/or isolated reservations where they are graciously allowed to exist as a community, mostly assimilated into an American style society. Federal policies that exist to erase tribes linger in effect today, with tribal membership usually restricted on the basis of an arbitrary blood quantum, cutting off natives from their tribes legally and oftentimes socially. When you combine these and other factors, it's not surprising that Native Americans are denied a place in the public consciousness.

As a young person of indigenous ancestry, my ethnicity can be a tough subject to breach. When Native Americans are portrayed in popular culture, it is so often offensive or insensitive that oftentimes I'd rather just not talk about being native at all for fear of facing some racist aside. We're the only racial group in the United States that has to deal with a racial slur being a team name in professional sports. When Chris Pratt's character in Jurassic World made a casually racist quip about not being able to follow scent trails (like a dog would) because he wasn't Navajo, there was no outrage, no fuss. The racial group killed at the highest rate by police? Not African-Americans, but Native Americans. Yet none of the murders make national headlines. The fight for equality for native people is far from over, and many days it feels like a bleak and hopeless endeavour.

To a certain degree, I have to fight that fight within myself as well. I'm well aware of my mixed blood, and of my lack of tribal enrollment. I have to deal with the personal stigma that comes with not being a 'legal Indian', because I can't provide a satisfactory percentage. My very existence is a circumstance of globalization, an anthropologically absurd mashup of Ute and Mexican and English, born in Canada. I'm a contradiction to the pre-colonial world that a lot of natives dream about, and that creates inner conflict. But I've come to learn that it's more important to learn from what I've been given than fret over labels and identity politics. Our traditional native ways of egalitarianism and connection with nature, our stories and our values; they're more than they seem. They're tools to define my life, and to use to shape the world around me into what I believe it should be. The road to social justice is a long and hard one, and sometimes the obstacles in the way are vicious enough to take away your will to fight. The questions and problems I face are complex, and I don't have the answers. But as long as native communities are marginalized and struggling, I'll walk the road with pride.
