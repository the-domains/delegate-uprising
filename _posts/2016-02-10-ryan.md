Before Youth & Government, loving myself was a foreign concept. Of all the hatred in the world, it felt as if my contempt for myself was greater than any other. The worst part was a sense of hopelessness as I continued to realize more and more that this part of myself I hated so much, I could never change. I would give all the money in the world to have made myself realize even one day sooner that there is no shame in being who I am: that there is no shame in who you love; that there is no shame in being bisexual. 

Much to my misfortune it took me many years to realize this undeniable truth. As an insecure and confused freshman I would put on a smiling face and act as if everything was normal. I felt that if only I could act normal, maybe I could finally be "normal".

Maybe this mask of a smiling face and charismatic personality would somehow become true. But what I failed to realize was that hiding your true self is not a path to happiness. This mask of happiness would crumble every time my head hit the pillow at night. As I nestled under the covers at night I would turn off the light and turn up the music on my phone just loud enough so nobody would hear my distress and nobody could see my tears. I'd clasp my hands together, tears streaming down my face, and pray to god for him to change me. "God, if you love me, make me normal." "God, if you love me, take the gay away" "God, if you love me, put me out of my misery."

As I started my sophomore year, the only thing I could be sure of was that these feelings I had weren't going to be taken away by any god I knew. I was undeniably bisexual, but I wasn't ready to accept it. Each day drug on, and each "gay" thought I had would parallel a suicidal one. I was los

t in a world of shame and pity, and it seemed as if there was nothing to release me from behind the bars of depression. I was looking for a sweet escape, and the end of a life with more potential than I could comprehend seemed to be just that. 

It was at that same time a friend of mine dragged me to the first meeting of El Dorado Youth and Government. As I dug deeper and deeper into the world of Y&G, I found a community of love and acceptance outside of my small conservative town. For the first time, I found a place where I could be loved for who I am. I found a place that changed my life forever. I found my sweet escape. Even though I was not ready to outwardly express it, I began to love myself for the first time. It was 6 months after my first MLC that it took me ten minutes to choke out the words "I am bisexual" to my best friend for the first time ever. 

The tears never leave. In fact, the tears in my eyes as I type this story make it increasingly harder and harder to continue. But these tears are no longer out of sadness. I cry because of how lucky I am to have found a program that has allowed me to love myself. I cry because I now have the opportunity to help others because I have the opportunity to change lives just as Y&G has changed mine. So if you struggle with your sexuality, remember that there is always a sweet escape for you, and suicide is never the answer. There is always a place for you, and Y&G just may be that place.
