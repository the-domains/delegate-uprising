# Molly

I truly believe there's no program out there as empowering and life changing as Youth and Government.

In Sacramento a bill about school counselors being trained for emotional issues came up, so I felt that it might be important to tell my story on how my counselor helped me come out as bisexual.

It's really terrifying sharing this experience, since you're putting yourself out there into a vulnerable position- you never know how people will respond.

However, when I finished telling my story I looked up and saw a sea of kind and loving faces, that helped me feel that it's okay to be myself.

Never in my entire life have I ever felt so accepted, and it's really remarkable for there to be a place filled with so many people that take you for yourself.
