Growing up I never felt like I had a voice. Since the beginning of second grade throughout most of high school. In delegation meetings I didn't talk and I made three friends my first year in the program. I learned a lot throughout this first year. Everyone has an opinion and we should all be able to express it in whatever way we choose. 

In my program area we did a lot of research on the impacts bills had on the state level and national level when it came to money. I lot of my bills were easy to do but there was one bill that gave no numbers. So in order to actually make it pass I found another organization like the one proposed in the bill and based my speech off of that. The author did not agree with my numbers at all. Which I found out the first time I ever spoke in session without any warning whatsoever. What this experience taught me was in life there are going to be details left out, or forgotten just because we don't assume how important they are. But it's our job to figure out those little things and make the difference. We are the ones who make the difference and even if no one listens at first we have a voice that together can move nations (and national issues). This program has given me a voice I thought I'd never find. I grew up with a sister who did everything and made friends with everyone. I never got that chance.
