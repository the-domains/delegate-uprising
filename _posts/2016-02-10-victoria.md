Silent I was no longer.

In Youth and Government, we pride ourselves of fueling the next generation of leaders. I am here to tell you what fueled me to take action.

Ever since a young age I knew that my accomplishments were not just for me. They were for my family, my community. If I got an A on a test it showed that my community could do it. Whenever I went into an election I knew it was time to point out the flaws of the system and propose solutions. It is hard to voice your concerns and opinions when these systems do not reflect the people or their reality they face.

To me, the purpose of a government is to point out the trends of society and either fix them for its betterment or to find a way to make them last. The vessel we use as communication in our society is our voices. That is how we make change. That is how we hear everyone. How are we supposed to hear all OUR people when they are not represented in our government? As a Chicana, as a feminist, as a person from a low income area, who in our government looks like me?

As my one of my favorite author said, "...we have been socialized to respect fear more than our own needs for language and definition, and while we wait in silence for that final luxury of fearlessness, the weight of that silence will choke us."

For years, my people have been silenced from our education systems, our prison system, and our government. How much longer can a human wait? How long can a person see injustice and sit still before they resist?

In Youth and Government, I refuse to sit still and watch our precious program fall into the same systemic oppression that plagues our actual politics. We are suppose to be the model of the government we want to see. I demand my government to see and recognize me.

No longer shall we be comfortable in the back of a crowd. No longer shall we succumb to the 'social norms' of what others deem fits us. I am so proud of those who have spoken up and who have tried their hardest to create more representation in this program. I want to shout out Berkeley Delegation for vocalizing the discrimination they felt at their school and rallying about it. Shout out to the delegates who are not afraid to speak their opinions and voice the concerns facing their communities. Shout out to those who dare to question the system

Youth and Government, it is time to wake up. It is time to be awoken.

Stay Woke and use your voice.
