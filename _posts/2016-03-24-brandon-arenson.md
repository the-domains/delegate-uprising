# Brandon Arenson

Have you ever had those days when you just feel... alone? Like, you know your friends around you but like you don't really fathom their existence just as your friends. Now imagine that, but every day of your entire life. That's what I suffer from, and I don't know if it's one of my 10 currently diagnosed disorders (Which includes PTSD, Minor Schizophrenia, High Spectrum Autism, and Severe Clinical Anxiety and Depression) or undiagnosed, but I do know that I suffer from it. When I was 10, my parents sat me and my brother down and told us that they would be separating and ever since them I don't feel like I've been the same, I still remember the countless nights in the backyard when I would hug my brother and talk about how we'd never turn on each other like our parents turned on us. 

Fast forward a year, I was diagnosed with my first five which were the 5 that I listed earlier, and after that I no longer felt like a person. Ever since that day, I feel as if my struggle to get a better life and to leave the dark abyss of depression and anti-love that I'm stuck in just got even deeper. So fast forward to now, a few diagnosys, cuts, attempts, cries, and fake friends later. I still suffer from my past back then. But that doesn't mean you have to. Please, if you're reading this, then remember to stay strong, weakness is a symptom of irrationality, not greatness. I've gotten beaten up and screwed around with and that hasn't ended now, but I've never been anything but myself. So just remember, that you can't beautiful, if you can't be you.
