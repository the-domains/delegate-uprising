Of all the hatred in the world, it felt as if my contempt for myself was greater than any other. The worst part was a sense of hopelessness as I continued to realize more and more that this part of myself I hated so much, I could never change. I would give all the money in the world to have made myself realize even one day sooner that there is no shame in being who I am: that there is no shame in who you love; that there is no shame in being bisexual.Â </p><p>Much to my misfortune it took me many years to realize this undeniable truth. As an insecure and confused freshman I would put on a smiling face and act as if everything was normal. I felt that if only I could act normal, maybe I could finally be ânormalâ.</p><p>Maybe this mask of a smiling face and charismatic personality would somehow become true. But what I failed to realize was that hiding your true self is not a path to happiness. This mask of happiness would crumble every time my head hit the pillow at night. As I nestled under the covers at night I wouldÂ turn off the light andÂ turn up the music on my phone just loud enough so nobody would hear my distress and nobody could see my tears. Iâd clasp my hands together, tears streaming down my face, and pray to god for him to change me. âGod, if you love me, make me normal.â âGod, if you love me, take the gay awayâ âGod, if you love me, put me out of my misery.â</p><p>As I started my sophomore year, the only thing I could be sure of was that these feelings I had werenât going to be taken away by any god I knew. I was undeniably bisexual, but I wasnât ready to accept it. Each day drug on, and each âgayâ thought I had would parallel a suicidal one. I was lost in a world of shame and pity, and it seemed as if there was nothing to release me from behind the bars of depression. I was looking for a sweet escape, and the end of a life with more potential than I could comprehend seemed to be just that.Â </p><p>It was at that same time a friend of mine dragged me to the first meeting of El Dorado Youth and Government. As I dug deeper and deeper into the world of Y&G, I found a community of love and acceptance outside of my small conservative town. For the first time, I found a place where I could be loved for who I am. I found a place that changed my life forever. I found my sweet escape. Even though I was not ready to outwardly express it, I began to love myself for the first time. It was 6 months after my first MLC that it took me ten minutes to choke out the words âI am bisexualâ to my best friend for the first time ever.Â </p><p>The tears never leave. In fact, the tears in my eyes as I type this story make it increasingly harder and harder to continue. But these tears are no longer out of sadness. I cry because of how lucky I am to have found a program that has allowed me to love myself. I cry because I now have the opportunity to help others because I have the opportunity to change lives just as Y&G has changed mine. So if you struggle with your sexuality, remember that there is always a sweet escape for you, and suicide is never the answer. There is always a place for you, and Y&G just may be that place.</p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="51"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="52"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="53"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="54"><span data-reactid="55"><!-- react-empty: 56 --><h2 data-reactid="57"><a data-reactid="58">Delegate Uprising</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="59"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="60"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="61"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="62"></div></section></div></div>
