I’m Brendan Thompson, a junior from the North Valley YMCA. Y & G has brought so much joy and passion into my life. Sacramento 2015 was probably the best week of my life. Unfortunately that’s not what I’ll be sharing with you today. Rather I will be talking about my worst weeks, my lowest points and how I both overcame and learned from them.</p><p>Apparently my mom saw it in me from a young age. It wasn’t until I was a teenager that I fully realized it myself. The actual dates are a bit jumbled in my head now. In the fall of the eighth grade, I wanted to die. More than anything else. It crept up on me pretty quickly. All of a sudden I couldn’t handle school, couldn’t do homework. I couldn’t even eat. Eventually sleep was a luxury that I know longer knew. All I knew were dark thoughts and tears. Words didn’t come so easily. </p><p>Finally, my mom got me to see a psychiatrist and he prescribed me some medications. A mix of an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer had fixed it all in the matter of a night when it was meant to take weeks. I will never know why or how it worked so fast. All I could be was grateful. </p><p>The story doesn’t end there. Nearly six months later, I was right back where I started. I had stopped taking my medication. Depression had taken over again. This time I ended up in a psychiatric hospital. It was a terrible and great place. Everyone was was there because they needed help, but not everyone had made that decision themselves. It was essentially a room full of unstable teens with nothing to do half the time. The average stay was apparently 3 to 5 days. I was there nearly two weeks. I fought, I cried, I made friends, and slowly I started to get better. A little too much better.</p><p>I was back in the hospital less than a month after I left. This time, not for depression, but mania. I had gone insane. I had developed insomnia, started talking to myself, and started having delusions. It turned out I’m bipolar and the antidepressant wasn’t helping me. Once I got the right diagnosis, I was put back on one of my original medications that was right for me.</p><p>My story may seem a bit sad, but that’s not the point. What matters is that I got better. I have a wonderful life now. And if you’re going through anything, please know you can get through it too however impossible it may seem. I still take my medication and go to therapy today although it’s been years. Those methods don’t work for everyone, but I highly recommend consulting a professional. With my aspirations to be a politician, I hope that one day I can make a difference for those who are experiencing pain and suffering like I was, and that my condition won’t hold me back. If you ever need me I’m just an email or a Facebook message away, because while so many suffer with their guards up, I know that a conversation has the potential to save a life.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Brendan Munro Thompson</p><p><a href="mailto:brendanmunrooo@gmail.com"></a></p><p><a href="mailto:brendanmunrooo@gmail.com">brendanmunrooo@gmail.com</a></p><p><b></b></p><p><i><a href="mailto:brendanmunrooo@gmail.com"></a></i></p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="53"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="54"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="55"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="56"><span data-reactid="57"><!-- react-empty: 58 --><h2 data-reactid="59"><a data-reactid="60">Delegate Uprising</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="61"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="62"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="63"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="64"></div></section></div></div>
